# Natural language processing


Natural language processing (NLP) is the field of computer sciences focused on retrieving information from textual input generated by human beings.



## Create a term frequency matrix


The simplest approach to the problem (and the most commonly used so far) is to split sentences into **tokens**. Simplifying, **words** have abstract and subjective meanings to the people using and receiving them, **tokens** have an objective interpretation: an ordered sequence of characters (or bytes). Once sentences are split, the order of the token is disregarded. This approach to the problem in known as **bag of words** model.

A **term frequency** is a dictionary, in which to each token is assigned a **weight**. In the first example, we construct a term frequency matrix from a corpus **corpus** (a collection of **documents**) with the R package `tm`.

```r
require(tm)
doc1 <- "drugs hospitals doctors"
doc2 <- "smog pollution environment"
doc3 <- "doctors hospitals healthcare"
doc4 <- "pollution environment water"
corpus <- c(doc1, doc2, doc3, doc4)
tm_corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(corpus))

```

In this example, we created a corpus of class `Corpus` defined by the package `tm` with two functions `Corpus` and `VectorSource`, which returns a `VectorSource` object from a character vector. The object `tm_corpus` is a list our documents with additional (and optional) metadata to describe each document.

```r
str(tm_corpus)
List of 4
 $ 1:List of 2
  ..$ content: chr "drugs hospitals doctors"
  ..$ meta   :List of 7
  .. ..$ author       : chr(0) 
  .. ..$ datetimestamp: POSIXlt[1:1], format: "2017-06-03 00:31:34"
  .. ..$ description  : chr(0) 
  .. ..$ heading      : chr(0) 
  .. ..$ id           : chr "1"
  .. ..$ language     : chr "en"
  .. ..$ origin       : chr(0) 
  .. ..- attr(*, "class")= chr "TextDocumentMeta"
  ..- attr(*, "class")= chr [1:2] "PlainTextDocument" "TextDocument"
[truncated]

```

Once we have a `Corpus`, we can proceed to preprocess the tokens contained in the `Corpus` to improve the quality of the final output (the term frequency matrix). To do this we use the `tm` function `tm_map`, which similarly to the `apply` family of functions, transform the documents in the corpus by applying a function to each document.

```r
tm_corpus <- tm_map(tm_corpus, tolower)
tm_corpus <- tm_map(tm_corpus, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
tm_corpus <- tm_map(tm_corpus, removeNumbers)
tm_corpus <- tm_map(tm_corpus, PlainTextDocument)
tm_corpus <- tm_map(tm_corpus, stemDocument, language="english")
tm_corpus <- tm_map(tm_corpus, stripWhitespace)
tm_corpus <- tm_map(tm_corpus, PlainTextDocument)

```

Following these transformations, we finally create the term frequency matrix with

```r
tdm <- TermDocumentMatrix(tm_corpus)

```

which gives a

```r
<<TermDocumentMatrix (terms: 8, documents: 4)>>
Non-/sparse entries: 12/20
Sparsity           : 62%
Maximal term length: 9
Weighting          : term frequency (tf)

```

that we can view by transforming it to a matrix

```r
as.matrix(tdm)

           Docs
Terms       character(0) character(0) character(0) character(0)
  doctor               1            0            1            0
  drug                 1            0            0            0
  environ              0            1            0            1
  healthcar            0            0            1            0
  hospit               1            0            1            0
  pollut               0            1            0            1
  smog                 0            1            0            0
  water                0            0            0            1

```

Each row represents the frequency of each token - that as you noticed have been stemmed (e.g. `environment` to `environ`) - in each document (4 documents, 4 columns).

In the previous lines, we have weighted each pair token/document with the absolute frequency (i.e. the number of instances of the token that appear in the document).
